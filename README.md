## About

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about mathematics, algorithms, and computational art.

The animation above is **Prime Resonance** - a generative visualization that explores number-theoretic sequences through particle dynamics. It treats mathematical sequences (primes, Collatz trajectories, Fibonacci progressions) as wave functions that create energy fields, which flow particles navigate to reveal hidden mathematical patterns.

### My Work

I explore fascinating mathematical problems including:
- 🔢 **Prime Numbers** - Algorithms for finding and analyzing primes
- 🔄 **Collatz Conjecture** - Investigating the famous 3n+1 problem
- 📊 **Lychrel Numbers** - Searching for palindromes in reverse-add sequences
- 🧮 **Brocard's Problem** - Working on n! + 1 = m²
- 💰 **Algorithmic Investing** - Applying math to financial models
